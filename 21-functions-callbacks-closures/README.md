# Higher Order Functions
- Receives a function as an argument 
- Returns the function as output.
- or both

# CallBack Functions
#### What are callback functions?
- Callbacks are just regular Functions! What makes it a callback is how we use it.
- A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

#### Write some example code
- Where have we already seen callbacks used in JS?
- Create a callback using *setInterval* or *setTimeout* - Demo asynchronous js
- Use callbacks to write cleaner more resusable code.

# Closure Functions
#### What are closures?
- A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time. -MDN
#### Write some example code
- multiplier
- Counter 
- add name to an array
- counter + object factory
